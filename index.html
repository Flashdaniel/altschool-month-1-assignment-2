        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Daniel Nweze was born on November 5th, 1996, in Enugu, Nigeria, to
          Alphonse and Florence Nweze. He is the first of seven children, two of
          whom were adopted into the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, Daniel faced significant challenges at home. His father,
          Alphonse Nweze, was an abusive, unsupportive man who struggled with a
          womanizing nature. His disregard for his family, particularly his
          children, left a deep impact on Daniel. Despite being their biological
          father, Alphonse often acted as though he wasn’t involved in their
          lives, which created a difficult and emotionally strained environment
          for the children.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Daniel’s mother, Florence Nweze, is a loving and
          devoted parent. She worked tirelessly to provide for her children,
          always going above and beyond to ensure their well-being and
          happiness. Her unwavering love and support made her the pillar of
          strength in the family, and she is cherished by all of her children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel has always been a curious individual with a passion for
          learning. His interests span across various areas, but he has a
          particular affinity for building electrical devices and exploring
          technology. This inquisitiveness and drive for knowledge have shaped
          his current career aspirations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Daniel is pursuing a career in the tech industry. His
          ambition is to be among the top 3% most successful software engineers
          in the world. Although he has been learning on his own, he is excited
          to have recently gained admission to Altschool Africa, where he will
          continue to further his education and skills in the tech field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through perseverance, determination, and the support of his mother,
          Daniel is determined to make a name for himself in the world of
          technology, overcoming his challenging upbringing and reaching for
          success.

        <h2>Why join the Altschool Africa program</h2>
        <p>
          Although I have been learning on my own, I’ve struggled to break into
          the tech world and lack the structure necessary to learn effectively.
          I truly believe that in order to make my dream a reality, I must do
          everything possible. I need a mentor, a friend, a colleague, someone
          like me, and a support system to help lift me up and guide me toward
          success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that Altschool has exactly what I need to reach my goals. I
          am committed to making the most of every opportunity it offers,
          utilizing everything it has to help me climb to the top of my
          ambitions. I won’t let anything stand in my way.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is simple: to become the best version of myself. I aim to be
          among the top 3% of software engineers globally, driving change,
          fostering innovation, and collaborating with the brightest minds in
          the world. I want to reshape the tech landscape, making every
          challenge solvable. I strive to go beyond expectations, where the sky
          is just the beginning, not the limit.
        </p>
        <p>That’s my mission.</p>
